# PolyTree

At some stage this'll be a simple BSP generator of .OBJ files, probably with some kind of preview function and with an export option that spits the model out in either binary or ascii, using 16.16 fixed point accuracy for vertices etc.

That's the plan, anyway.


Does sweet FA so far other than display the [ImGui demo setup](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
